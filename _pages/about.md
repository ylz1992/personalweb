Hi, I'm Alan, a PhD student in the [Machine Learning Group](https://www.cs.tulane.edu/~jhamm3/) at Tulane University, advised by with Prof. Jihun Hamm. My research interests broadly span ML privacy and safety.

Previously, I did my CS Master's at Georgia Tech, and my undergraduate degree at Beijing Jiaotong University. 

I used to worked as a R&D engineer; You can find [highlights of my designs](/personalweb/blog/2024/Portfolio-Highlights-at-CADG/). Outside research, I enjoy studying Spanish, reading poetry, and playing tennis.
