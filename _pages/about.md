Hi, I'm Alan, a Master's Student in computer science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), currently work as a RA at [Efficient And Intelligent Computing Lab](https://eiclab.scs.gatech.edu/). My research surrounds Trustworthy AI and ML Safety, with current projects exploring robustness and jailbreak methods in T2I models and VLMs. I'm interested in developing red-teaming methodologies to enhance reliability of LLM/VLMs.

Previously, I worked as a R&D engineer; You can find [highlights of my designs](/personalweb/blog/2024/Portfolio-Highlights-at-CADG/). Outside research, I enjoy studying Spanish, reading poetry, and playing tennis.
